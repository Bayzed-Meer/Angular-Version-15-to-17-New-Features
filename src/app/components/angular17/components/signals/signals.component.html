  <h1>Signals</h1>
  <p>
    Angular Signals is a system that granularly tracks how and where your state
    is used throughout an application, allowing the framework to optimize
    rendering updates.
  </p>
  <p>
    It's like a wrapper around a value that can notify interested consumers when
    that value changes. Signals can contain any value, from simple primitives to
    complex data structures.
  </p>
  <h2>Writable signals</h2>
  <pre><code class="language-typescript">const count = signal(0);
// Signals are getter functions - calling them reads their value.
console.log('The count is: ' + count());</code></pre>

  <p class="pt-2">
    To change the value of a writable signal, you can either .set() it directly:
  </p>
  <pre><code class="language-typescript">count.set(3);</code></pre>
  <p class="pt-2">
    or use the .update() operation to compute a new value from the previous one:
  </p>
  <pre><code class="language-typescript">// Increment the count by 1.
count.update(value => value + 1);</code></pre>

  <h2 class="pt-2">Computed signals</h2>
  <p>
    A computed signal derives its value from other signals. Define one using
    computed and specifying a derivation function:
  </p>
  <pre><code class="language-typescript">const count: WritableSignal&lt;number&gt; = signal(0);
const doubleCount: Signal&lt;number&gt; = computed(() => count() * 2);</code></pre>

  <p class="pt-2">
    The doubleCount signal depends on count. Whenever count updates, Angular
    knows that anything which depends on either count or doubleCount needs to
    update as well.
  </p>
  <h2>Effects</h2>
  <p>
    Signals are useful because they can notify interested consumers when they
    change. An effect is an operation that runs whenever one or more signal
    values change. You can create an effect with the effect function:
  </p>
  <pre><code class="language-typescript">effect(() =&gt;  &#123;
  console.log('The current count is: count()');
&#125;);</code></pre>

  <p class="pt-2">
    Effects always run at least once. When an effect runs, it tracks any signal
    value reads. Whenever any of these signal values change, the effect runs
    again. Similar to computed signals, effects keep track of their dependencies
    dynamically, and only track signals which were read in the most recent
    execution.
  </p>
  <p>
    Effects always execute asynchronously, during the change detection process.
  </p>
  <h2>Let's look at an example of signals</h2>
  <pre><code class="language-typescript">&#64;Component(&#123;
  selector: 'app-signals',
  template: `&lt;button (state)="check()"&gt;Call Signal&lt;/button&gt;`
&#125;)

// Declaring signals
price = signal&lt;number&gt;(5);
quantity = signal&lt;number&gt;(2);

// Computed signal
totalCost = computed(() =&gt; this.price() * this.quantity());

state = signal&lt;boolean&gt;(false);

// Use case of effect
constructor() &#123;
  effect(() =&gt; &#123;
    console.log("Effects called");
  &#125;);
&#125;

check() &#123;
  console.log(this.totalCost());
  this.state.set(!this.state());
&#125;</code></pre>

  <p class="pt-2">
    When the state button is clicked, we toggle its value and log the total
    price, which is calculated via a computed signal. Additionally, each time
    the state button is clicked, the effects are executed.
  </p>
