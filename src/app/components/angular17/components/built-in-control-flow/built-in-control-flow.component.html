  <h1>Built-in Control Flow</h1>
  <p>
    Built-in control flow offers a new way to manage template logic. This
    feature aims to improve developer experience by offering a more intuitive
    and concise syntax compared to directives like *ngIf, *ngFor, and *ngSwitch.
    The new syntax is closer to JavaScript and provides features like better
    type checking and optional else-if blocks for conditional statements.
    Built-in control flow also boasts significant performance improvements,
    especially with the new for loop that offers up to 90% faster runtime
    compared to *ngFor. This new feature is currently available in Angular 17
    under developer preview.
  </p>

  <h2>Conditional Statements</h2>
  <p>Letâ€™s look at a side-by-side comparison with *ngIf:</p>
  <pre><code>{{ ngif }}</code></pre>
  <p>With the built-in if statement, this condition will look like:</p>
  <pre><code>{{ newif }}</code></pre>
  <p>
    In the current control flow, you can use
    <span class="text-red-500">else-if</span>, which historically has been
    impossible.
  </p>
  <pre><code>{{ elseif }}</code></pre>

  <p>Let's look at switch case:</p>
  <pre><code>{{ ngSwitch }}</code></pre>
  <p>which with the built-in control flow turns into:</p>
  <pre><code>{{ newSwitch }}</code></pre>

  <h2>Built-in For Loop</h2>
  <p>
    Angular v17 debuts a groundbreaking built-in for loop, accelerating
    rendering speeds by up to 90% compared to *ngFor. Key features include a new
    diffing algorithm for lightning-fast updates, a mandatory
    <span class="text-red-500">track</span> attribute, and an optional
    <span class="text-red-500">empty</span> block for empty collections. This
    update ensures smoother, more efficient Angular applications with seamless
    migration paths.
  </p>
  <p>*ngFor directive:</p>
  <pre><code>{{ ngFor }}</code></pre>
  <p>The new For Loop:</p>
  <pre><code>{{ newFor }}</code></pre>

  <h2>Track for Calculating Difference of Two Collections</h2>
  <p>
    The for block requires a track expression. Angular uses the value of this
    expression as a unique identity for each item. This identity allows the
    framework to perform the minimal set of DOM operations necessary after items
    are added, removed, or reordered.
  </p>
  <p>
    If your items do not contain any key property to uniquely identify them, you
    can use `$index` in the track expression.
  </p>
  <pre><code>{{ trackWithIndex }}</code></pre>

  <h2>$index and Other Contextual Variables</h2>
  <p>Inside for contents, several implicit variables are always available:</p>
  <table>
    <tr>
      <th>Variable</th>
      <th>Meaning</th>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>$count</td>
      <td>Number of items in a collection iterated over</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>$index</td>
      <td>Index of the current row</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>$first</td>
      <td>Whether the current row is the first row</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>$last</td>
      <td>Whether the current row is the last row</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>$even</td>
      <td>Whether the current row index is even</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>$odd</td>
      <td>Whether the current row index is odd</td>
    </tr>
  </table>
  <p>
    These variables are always available with these names but can be aliased via
    a let segment:
  </p>
  <pre><code>{{ contextualVariables }}</code></pre>
  <p>
    The aliasing is especially useful in the case of using nested for blocks
    where contextual variable names could collide.
  </p>

  <h2>Let's Look at an Example of Track</h2>
  <p>*ngFor:</p>
  <ul>
    <li *ngFor="let user of users">{{ user.name }}</li>
  </ul>
  <p>For Loop</p>
  <ul>
    @for(user of users; track user.id) {
    <li>{{ user.name }}</li>
    }
  </ul>

  <button (click)="clone()" class="py-1 px-3 mb-4 rounded-lg bg-slate-300">
    Clone
  </button>

  <p>
    Now, open the inspect view and observe the li elements in the DOM. When the
    "Clone" button is clicked, the `*ngFor` directive creates new `li` elements.
    On the other hand, the new `for` loop keeps track of the items, enabling the
    framework to perform the minimal set of DOM operations necessary.
  </p>
