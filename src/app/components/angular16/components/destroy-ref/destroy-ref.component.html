  <h1>DestroyRef</h1>
  <p>
    Angular v16 has introduced a new provider called DestroyRef, which allows
    for registering destroy callbacks for a specific lifecycle scope. This
    feature is applicable to components, directives, pipes, embedded views, and
    instances of EnvironmentInjector.
  </p>
  <p>
    The usage of DestroyRef is straightforward. We can inject the DestroyRef
    provider and register a destroy callback like so:
  </p>
  <pre><code>{{destroyref}}</code></pre>
  <p>
    Using DestroyRef, itâ€™s possible to create reusable logic that performs
    necessary cleanup tasks when a scope is destroyed without the need for
    inheritance. This simplifies the implementation process and reduces
    complexity.
  </p>
  <p>
    For example, we can create an untilDestroyed operator that relies on
    DestroyRef:
  </p>
  <pre><code>{{func}}</code></pre>
  <pre><code>{{foo}}</code></pre>
</div>
