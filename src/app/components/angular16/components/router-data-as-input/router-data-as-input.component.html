  <h1>Router data as components inputs in Angular v16</h1>
  <p>
    Up until now, we have considered properties decorated with &#64;Input as
    properties bound to the DOM properties. These properties can be used to pass
    data from parent to child. For instance, if a child component has an input
    property called name, we can use it like this:
  </p>
  <pre><code>{{child}}</code></pre>
  <p>
    Starting from Angular version 16, we can use inputs to declare properties
    that will bind to route parameters.
  </p>
  <p>What does this mean? Let's consider the following route definition:</p>
  <pre><code>{{route}}</code></pre>
  <p>
    When we need to obtain the ID in our component, such as when fetching a hero
    using its ID, we would do the following in the component:
  </p>
  <pre><code>{{activated}}</code></pre>
  <p>Now we can use &#64;Input for that. It's as simple as that.</p>
  <pre><code>{{new}}</code></pre>
  <h2>Thatâ€™s not all! We can access variety of route parameters, including:</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Route parameters</li>
    <li>Query parameters</li>
    <li>Route data from the data property</li>
    <li>Route data from resolvers</li>
  </ul>
  <p>Let's quickly check the rest, starting from this route definition:</p>
  <pre><code>{{rest}}</code></pre>
  <p>We have</p>
  <ul>
    <li>id as route parameter</li>
    <li>heroName as data from resolver</li>
    <li>heroPower as data from data property</li>
  </ul>
  <p>
    In the component, we can add input properties for all of these, as well as
    an additional one for a query parameter, as follows:
  </p>
  <pre><code>{{Childcom}}</code></pre>
  <p>
    That's it! Everything works automatically, and input properties pick up the
    current route parameters without the need for injecting ActivatedRoute into
    the component anymore.
  </p>
