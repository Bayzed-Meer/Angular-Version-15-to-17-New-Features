  <h1>RxJS interoperability</h1>
  <p>
    Angular v16 has introduced `toSignal`, `toObservable`, and
    `takeUntilDestroyed` to make signals and observables work together.
  </p>
  <h2>toSignal</h2>
  <p>
    Use the toSignal function to create a signal which tracks the value of an
    Observable. It behaves similarly to the async pipe in templates, but is more
    flexible and can be used anywhere in an application.
  </p>
  <pre><code>{{toSignal}}</code></pre>
  <p>
    Like the async pipe, toSignal subscribes to the Observable immediately,
    which may trigger side effects. The subscription created by toSignal
    automatically unsubscribes from the given Observable when the component or
    service which calls toSignal is destroyed.
  </p>
  <h2>toObservable</h2>
  <p>
    Use the toObservable utility to create an Observable which tracks the value
    of a signal. The signal's value is monitored with an effect which emits the
    value to the Observable when it changes.
  </p>
  <pre><code>{{toObservable}}</code></pre>
  <h2>takeUntilDestroyed</h2>
  <p>
    Angular users often want to complete a stream when a related subject
    completes. The following illustrative pattern is quite common:
  </p>
  <pre><code>{{old}}</code></pre>
  <p>
    Angular v16 introduces a new RxJS operator called takeUntilDestroyed, which
    simplifies this example into the following:
  </p>
  <pre><code>{{new}}</code></pre>
  <p>
    By default, this operator will inject the current cleanup context. For
    example, used in a component, it will use the component’s lifetime.
  </p>
  <p>
    takeUntilDestroyed is especially useful when you want to tie the lifecycle
    of an Observable to a particular component’s lifecycle.
