  <h1>CDK Listbox Module</h1>
  <p>
    Although we get most of the functionality from Angular CDK, we need to write
    quite a bit of code to build accessible lists.
  </p>
  <p>
    CdkListboxModule provides directives to help create accessible custom list
    boxes. To use it, we need to import the CdkListboxModule, which provides two
    directives â€” cdkListbox and cdkOption:
  </p>
  <pre><code>{{cdk}}</code></pre>
  <p>
    These two directives give us all the expected behavior for an accessible
    experience, such as bidi layout support and keyboard interaction. In
    addition, all directives apply their associated ARIA roles to their host
    elements.
  </p>
  <p>
    There is also support for Angular forms, disabling options, custom styles,
    orientation, options typehead, multiple selects, and more!
  </p>
