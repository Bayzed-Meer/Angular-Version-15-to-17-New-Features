  <h1>Directive composition API</h1>
  <p>
    Angular directives offer a great way to encapsulate reusable behaviorsâ€”
    directives can apply attributes, CSS classes, and event listeners to an
    element.
  </p>
  <p>
    The directive composition API lets you apply directives to a component's
    host element from within the component TypeScript class.
  </p>
  <h2>Adding directives to another directive</h2>
  <p>
    You can also add hostDirectives to other directives, in addition to
    components. This enables the transitive aggregation of multiple behaviors.
    It works similar to inheritance where you can merge two directives and make
    new one.
  </p>
  <pre><code>{{dtod}}</code></pre>
  <h2>Including inputs and outputs</h2>
  <p>
    When you apply hostDirectives to your component, the inputs and outputs from
    the host directives are not included in your component's API by default. You
    can explicitly include inputs and outputs in your component's API by
    expanding the entry in hostDirectives
  </p>
  <pre><code>{{input}}</code></pre>
